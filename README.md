# Project Set-Up üß∞

First, if you don't have any github account, make one and take a look at this <a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart">quickstart</a> wiki page to get the idea of contributions over github.

## Android Studio üíª
Next step it to setup the [Android Studio and the Android SDK.](https://www.google.com/search?q=Android+Studio+and+the+Android+SDK.&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) Open Android Studio and choose "Open Project", then select the folder where you earlier cloned the Github repository to.
On opening the project it should start to build and should eventually prompt you to install the following missing SDK components. Install them one by one as you get prompted.

**Note-** Android SDK Build-tools and Android SDK platform (version must match "buildToolsVersion" and "compileSdkVersion" in the project's build.gradle file)
After installing all the dependencies and components, the project should build successfully.

## Installing an emulator for testing üì±
[Setting up an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) is a very effective method for testing code/features and running the connected android tests **(Try to install the emulator which is selected as default by Android Studio).** However, use of any external hardware ([Android mobile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/android/emulator)) is also a good option but they are more time consuming. üôÇ

# Contribution Guidelines üéØ

- Before you start working on any issue/feaure, you are required to **claim it first** by writing any convincing claim message in the issue thread.
- If any issue is already assigned to someone else then you are **not allowed**:
  - to work or make any PR for that issue. No matter how best/good your work is, still it will not be reviewed and eventually closed.
  - to comment useless claim message again & again.
- **Follow PR template** while making your PRs.
- You are **not allowed to make any new issues**.
- Do not make PR which is not related to any issues.
- **Proper documentation and code refactoring PRs are always acceptable**, there will be issues open for them everytime labelled as **documentation** & **code refactoring**, you don't need to claim them, you just make PRs of your relevent work towards these issues.  


Now you are **all set** to contribute to this project. üëç
